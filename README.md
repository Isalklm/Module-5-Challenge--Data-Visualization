# Mice Treatment Analysis

## Description
This assignment involves analyzing a dataset on mice treated with different drug regimens to study their effects on tumor growth.
The main objective is to perform exploratory data analysis, visualize the distribution of tumor volumes, and understand correlations between mouse weight and tumor volume.

## Contents
- **data/**: 
  - `Mouse_metadata.csv`: Contains metadata about the mice, such as ID, age, weight, and sex.
  - `Study_results.csv`: Contains results of the tumor volume measurements over different time points.

- **notebooks/**: 
  - `Mice_Treatment_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and statistical calculations.

- **images/**: 
  - Contains images of charts and graphs generated during the analysis.

- **README.md**: This file.
